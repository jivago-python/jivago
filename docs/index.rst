Jivago â€“ The highly-reflective object-oriented Python framework
===========================================================================

Jivago is an object-oriented, highly-reflective Python framework for building web applications. It relies heavily on type annotations and decorators to enforce typing, providing package auto-discovery and dependency injection out of the box. This leads to less boilerplate code, while maintaining loose-coupling across components.
